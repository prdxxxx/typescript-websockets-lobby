# typescript-websockets-lobby

This is a Typescript websockets server. It handles lobby creation and allows peers to exchange packets to create WebRTC P2P connections.

It is built and hosted on a Cloudflare worker.

#### TODO: completely re-write in Go, preserving the API.

### Running locally

Pre-requisite: [install yarn via corepack](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

```
yarn set version 4.5
```

```
yarn
```

```
yarn start
```

### Secrets

Create a file called `.dev.vars` and paste the secret key. This file is not committed.

```
SECRET_KEY="____YOUR_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY____"
```

NOTE: The default secret key for this project is reproduced below. It's not a "true" secret currently, it's just designed to bounce random traffic or port explorers.

```

### How to set up in Cloudflare

- Fork this project
- Log in to Cloudflare
- Go to Compute (Workers)
- Select: "Import a repository"
- Select the repository in GitHub (connect if needed)
- Name the project: `typescript-websockets-lobby`
- Open Advanced settings
- Update root directory path to: `typescript-websockets-lobby/`
- Note: no need to update watched files, the root is sufficient

- Once done build is complete, go to Settings:
  - Variables and Secrets
  - Select Secret
  - Name: `SECRET_KEY`
  - Value: Copy from `.dev.vars` above

TODO: Do we need a build command?
Note: Do not change the watch path, the root should be where the worker is located.

### Troubleshooting

If you get this when building:

```
Installing project dependencies: yarn
12:03:32.773	➤ YN0000: · Yarn 4.5.0

➤ YN0028: │ The lockfile would have been modified by this install, which is explicitly forbidden.
```

Solution: try: `yarn set version 4.5`

### Resources:

- Heavily adapted from: https://github.com/Hairic95/Godot-WebSocket-Multiplayer-Template

### Legacy Actions (may be incomplete)

```gdscript
enum ACTION {
	Confirm,
	GetUsers,
	PlayerJoin,
	PlayerLeft,
	GetLobbies,
	GetOwnLobby,
	CreateLobby,
	JoinLobby,
	LeaveLobby,
	LobbyChanged,
	GameStarted,
	MessageToLobby,
	PlayerInfoUpdate,
	# WebRTC Actions:
	NewPeerConnection,
	Offer,
	Answer,
	Candidate,
	KickPlayer,
	LobbyEvent,
}
```

### TODO: New Actions

```
enum ACTION {
  UserConnect,
  UserConfirm,
  UsersGet,
  UserDisconnect,
  UserDataUpdate,

  LobbiesGet,
  LobbyGetOwn,
  LobbyCreate,
  LobbyJoin,
  LobbyLeft,
  LobbyChanged,
  LobbyUserChanged,
  LobbyChat,
  LobbyKick,
  LobbyLock,
  LobbyUnlock,
  LobbyGameStart,

  PeerNewConnection
  PeerOffer
  PeerAnswer
  PeerCandidate

}

```

Note: Past-tense? i.e. LobbyJoined?
Note: Could be all present tense.
Note: maybe things that are just emitting are past-tense, where as sendable actions are present.
